# LsbStego
LsbStego is an interactive C# console application for Windows. By using LsbStego, arbitrary files (called messages) can be hidden inside the Least Significant Bits of BMP or PNG images (called carriers) by using the Sequential or a variant of the Randomized Hide and Seek algorithm. In order to maintain high confidentiality by combining Steganography with Cryptography, the tool may additionally encrypt messages using a pre-shared key and AES256-CBC before they are hidden.<br />
In fact, the resulting stego images that carry hidden messages look visually indentical to the used carrier images no matter how large the messages may be (as long as they fit into the carriers). The tool additionally implements a rating system. This means it automatically rates the images according to their suitability as carriers. Once an image with a rating R<sub>c</sub> of about 90% or higher is used as carrier, the resulting stego image is immune to statistical attacks (such as the ChiÂ²-attack) as well.
